LayerControl._validateInput needs to be changed to avoid use of layer._properties._mapExtents, which is no longer created nor used. the method seems to be still required however. - deleted
removeExtents method of MapMLLayer should not be responsible for removing individual extents when an extent is removed  from the map - deleted
deleted MapMLLayer.redraw method, which was only drawing templated layers via TemplatedLayer.redraw() - deleted
refactor MapMLLayer._onZoomAnim which relies on _mapExtents array, to rely on - done
map-extent elements in DOM / SD. - done?
refactor MapMLLayer._validateExtent to make sense.  Deleted reliance on this._properties._mapExtents, but a more meaningful program needs to be written
fix the bug that the checkbox initial state is set to unchecked - done

make map-select working
