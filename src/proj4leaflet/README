proj4leaflet.js 1.0.2 has a couple of issues that prevent it from working well
with proj4, and also on node.js.

In the first case, proj4 changed its api and instead of returning 0 in some
cases where a latitude or longitude could not be defined, it will now return
a NaN, which causes problems for proj4leaflet and leaflet.  

Details of the issue are here: https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet/issues/180

The second case, proj4leaflet is using an outdated test to determine if it is 
running on node, and so it slips through to thinking it's running on windows, 
yet the window object is undefined, so it fails with a message about Leaflet
and proj4 needing to be defined first, which is not reflective of the problem.

patch.diff contains these two fixes, and is applied to the proj4leaflet.js file 
as it is copied from node_modules.
