proj4leaflet.js 1.0.2 has a couple of issues that prevent it from working well
with proj4js, and also on node.js.

In the first case, proj4js changed its api and instead of returning 0 in some
cases where a latitude or longitude could not be defined, it will now return
a NaN, which causes problems for proj4leaflet.  I forget the details of why,
but I decided that changing the behaviour of proj4leaflet was the easiest course
of action, iirc because it would have required changes to leaflet in many places,
as well.

The second case, proj4leaflet is using an outdated test to determine if it is 
running on node, and so it slips through to thinking it's running on windows, 
yet the window object is undefined, so it fails with a message about Leaflet
and proj4 needing to be defined first, which is not reflective of the problem.

I set up a diff patch that can make these changes to the node_modules version of
proj4leaflet.js, but I need to figure out how to apply the patch as I copy the
source file before uglifying it.  I think that jsdiff can be used, in the 
copy.process, but I need to figure out how to work with that api.

Of course, these things could be fixed if the proj4leaflet and leaflet projects
would accept a PR, but my impression was that they weren't interested, perhaps
because projections other than Web Mercator aren't of so much interest to them.
